KNOWN ISSUES

If the maxloop(1) value is to small the programm gets stuck if fast changes, like throwing an (fast) object through the field of view of the sensor,
appear. The programm will then contiously send "Range exceeded" and the measurement start procedure seems to get skipped, since the transmitter is no longer audible 
(it is during normal operation, very quiet though).
Disconnection the transmitter will lead to the state of "Range exceeded" but reconnecting does not lead to  contiuation of proper operation.

At higher values for maxloops, where the issue does not appear, another issue arises. Cutting the connection for the transmitter wont lead to the state of "Range exceeded". 
The programm seems to loop without output. But reconnecting leads to proper operation.
